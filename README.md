# JavaScript Calculator 2

This is a basic calculator project developed as part of the Fundamentos de Desenvolvimento de Software course in the An√°lise e Desenvolvimento de Sistemas program. The calculator allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
## Project Overview

The Calculador 2 project provides a simple user interface for performing basic arithmetic calculations. Users can input two numbers, select an operation (add, subtract, multiply, or divide), and get the result dynamically.

## Features

- Basic Arithmetic Operations: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Error Handling: If any of the input fields are empty, an error message is displayed.
- Dynamic Results: The result of the operation is displayed immediately after the user clicks the equals button.
## Tech Stack

**HTML**: For structuring the webpage and the form.
**CSS**: For styling the layout and the input fields.
**JavaScript**: For handling the calculation logic and interactivity.
## Code Explanation

JavaScript Logic

- Input Validation: If either of the input fields is empty, an error message will be displayed.
- Calculation: Based on the selected operation, the corresponding arithmetic operation is performed using parseInt() to convert the string inputs into numbers.
- Display Result: The result of the operation is displayed in the div element with the ID resposta.
## Folder Structure

- index.html: Main HTML file that contains the form and structure of the calculator.
- calculadora.css: CSS file containing the styles for the layout and design of the calculator.
- calculadora.js: JavaScript file containing the logic for calculations, input validation, and result display.
